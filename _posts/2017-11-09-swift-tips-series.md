description: My full Swift Tips series.
---

Recently, I wrote a series of Swift tips over at my [company’s blog](https://medium.com/bpxl-craft). This started out as a simple CocoaHeads talk where I was sharing my own personal best practices with the group.

1. [Striving for Smallness]
2. [Documentation]
3. [Organization]
4. [Access Control]
5. [Early Exits]
6. [Closure-Based CollectionType APIs]
7. [Property Configuration]
8. [Lazy Sequences]
9. [Debugging Slow Build Times]

I’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback. Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter [@blakemerryman](https://twitter.com/blakemerryman).
