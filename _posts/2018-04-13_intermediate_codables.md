<!--
2. Intermediate: Dealing with legacy code & Objective-C Interoperability:
    - `@objc` interoperability
    - Mapping to `NS_ENUM`
    - Mapping to non-`Codable` types
        - lazy-vars
        - private shadow types
    - Strategies for Converting legacy code to `Codable`:
        - Convert piece-meal and in-parallel
        - Maintaining Obj-C compatibility
