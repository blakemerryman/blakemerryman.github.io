For now, I&amp;rsquo;ve given up on my dream of a custom built solution in favor of Bear, a simple yet beautiful note taking solution. It even checks off many of the boxes from my wish list:
Powered by plain text. Preview/rendering options. Multi-media support. Hand writing / drawing support. Customizable organization (via tags).</description></item><item><title>Evernote Alternative?</title><link>http://www.blakemerryman.com/posts/2015-09-24-evernote-alternative/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Sep 2015 16:27:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.blakemerryman.com/posts/2015-09-24-evernote-alternative/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a long time Evernote user. With few exceptions, I dump everything that I think or discover into my Evernote database. I&amp;rsquo;ve even been a premium member until recently.
And yet, I&amp;rsquo;ve never loved Evernote. I feel like we have always been at odds. Things never work quite how I want them to and a lot of minor details leave me frustrated. I&amp;rsquo;ll save that rant for another post but the bottom line is this: I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a new note taking system for a long time and I&amp;rsquo;ve always been forced come back to Evernote because it is the lesser of many evils.</description></item></channel></rss>
