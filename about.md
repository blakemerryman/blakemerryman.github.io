I'm a Software Developer based in Nashville and proud [Middle Tennessee State University] alumnus.

I've been a professional iOS Developer since 2014 and you may have seen (or even used!) some of my work. I spent time at [Griffin Technology] (iOS Engineer) and [Aloompa] (Senior iOS Developer & Team Lead). I'm currently enjoying the remote life at [Black Pixel] (Senior iOS Developer). You can see my full work history over on [LinkedIn].

I'm also the Lead Organizer for [Nashville CocoaHeads].
