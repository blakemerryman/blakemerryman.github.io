I'm a Software Engineer at Apple and proud [Middle Tennessee State University] alumnus.

I've been a professional iOS Developer since 2014 and you may have seen (or even used!) some of my work. I spent time at [Griffin Technology] (iOS Engineer), [Aloompa] (Senior iOS Developer & Team Lead), and [Black Pixel] (Senior iOS Developer). I'm currently enjoying the West Coast life at Apple (Software Engineer). You can see my full work history over on [LinkedIn].

Any opinions on this site are my own.
